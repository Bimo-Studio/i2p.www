<h1>{{ _('I2P Firefox Browser Profile') }}</h1>
{% trans -%}
Your browser needs to be configured for use with I2P.  To make that easy, we are offering a Firefox browser profile pre-configured to work with I2P.  While you can use any browser to access I2P sites, using a dedicated browser profile keeps your I2P browsing activity separate from your clearnet activity.

The <a href="{{ installer }}">windows installer</a> will install the profile and configure I2P to use it.  You must already have Firefox and I2P installed.
