  in a Little Endian format.

  0.9.15. As of 0.9.16, a Key Certificate may be used to specify the signing
  public key type. See below.

* For `Garlic Cloves`_, the Certificate is always NULL, no others are currently
  implemented.

* For `Garlic Messages`_, the Certificate is always NULL, no others are
  currently implemented.

* For `Destinations`_, the Certificate may be non-NULL. As of 0.9.12, a Key
  Certificate may be used to specify the signing public key type. See below.

* Implementers are cautioned to prohibit excess data in Certificates.
  The appropriate length for each certificate type should be enforced.

Key Certificates
````````````````
Key certificates were introduced in release 0.9.12.  Prior to that release, all
PublicKeys were 256-byte ElGamal keys, and all SigningPublicKeys were 128-byte
DSA-SHA1 keys.  A key certificate provides a mechanism to indicate the type of
the PublicKey and SigningPublicKey in the Destination or RouterIdentity, and to
package any key data in excess of the standard lengths.

By maintaining exactly 384 bytes before the certificate, and putting any excess
key data inside the certificate, we maintain compatibility for any software
that parses Destinations and Router Identities.

The key certificate payload contains:

==================================  ======
              Data                  Length
==================================  ======
Signing Public Key Type (Integer_)    2
Crypto Public Key Type (Integer_)     2
Excess Signing Public Key Data        0+
Excess Crypto Public Key Data         0+
==================================  ======

The defined Signing Public Key types are:

reserved                   65535                                      Reserved for future expansion
======================  ===========  =======================  ======  =====

The defined Crypto Public Key types are:

========  ===========  =======================  =====
  Type     Type Code   Total Public Key Length  Usage
========  ===========  =======================  =====
ElGamal        0                 256            All Router Identities and Destinations
reserved  65280-65534                           Reserved for experimental use
reserved     65535                              Reserved for future expansion
========  ===========  =======================  =====

When a Key Certificate is not present, the preceeding 384 bytes in the
Destination or RouterIdentity are defined as the 256-byte ElGamal PublicKey
followed by the 128-byte DSA-SHA1 SigningPublicKey.  When a Key Certificate is
present, the preceeding 384 bytes are redefined as follows:

* Complete or first portion of Crypto Public Key

* Random padding if the total lengths of the two keys are less than 384 bytes

* Complete or first portion of Signing Public Key

The Crypto Public Key is aligned at the start and the Signing Public Key is
aligned at the end.  The padding (if any) is in the middle.  The lengths and
boundaries of the initial key data, the padding, and the excess key data
portions in the certificates are not explicitly specified, but are derived from
the lengths of the specified key types.  If the total lengths of the Crypto and
Signing Public Keys exceed 384 bytes, the remainder will be contained in the
Key Certificate.  If the Crypto Public Key length is not 256 bytes, the method
for determining the boundary between the two keys is to be specified in a
future revision of this document.

Example layouts using an ElGamal Crypto Public Key and the Signing Public Key
type indicated:

======================  ==============  ===============================

  val_string :: `String`
                A string (one byte length followed by UTF-8 encoded characters)

  ; :: A single byte containing ';'
{% endhighlight %}

Notes
`````
* The encoding isn't optimal - we either need the '=' and ';' characters, or
  the string lengths, but not both

* Some documentation says that the strings may not include '=' or ';' but this
  encoding supports them

* Strings are defined to be UTF-8 but in the current implementation, I2CP uses
  UTF-8 but I2NP does not. For example, UTF-8 strings in a RouterInfo options
  mapping in a I2NP Database Store Message will be corrupted.

* The encoding allows duplicate keys, however in any usage where the mapping is
  signed, duplicates may cause a signature failure.

* Mappings contained in I2NP messages (i.e. in a RouterAddress or RouterInfo)
  must be sorted by key so that the signature will be invariant. Duplicate keys
  are not allowed.

* Mappings contained in an `I2CP SessionConfig`_ must be sorted by key so that
  the signature will be invariant. Duplicate keys are not allowed.

* The sort method is defined as in Java String.compareTo(), using the Unicode
  value of the characters.

* While it is application-dependent, keys and values are generally
  case-sensitive.

* Key and value string length limits are 255 bytes (not characters) each, plus
  the length byte. Length byte may be 0.

* Total length limit is 65535 bytes, plus the 2 byte size field, or 65537
  total.

Notes
`````
* The public key of the destination was used for the old I2CP-to-I2CP
  encryption which was disabled in version 0.6, it is currently unused.

* The encryption key is used for end-to-end ElGamal/AES+SessionTag encryption
  [ELGAMAL-AES]_. It is currently generated anew at every router startup, it is
  not persistent.

* The signature may be verified using the signing public key of the
  destination.

* The signing_key is currently unused. It was intended for LeaseSet revocation,
  which is unimplemented. It is currently generated anew at every router
  startup, it is not persistent. The signing key type is always the same as the
  destination's signing key type.

* The earliest expiration of all the Leases is treated as the timestamp or
  version of the LeaseSet. Routers will generally not accept a store of a
  LeaseSet unless it is "newer" than the current one. Take care when publishing
  a new LeaseSet where the oldest Lease is the same as the oldest Lease in the
  previous LeaseSet. The publishing router should generally increment the
  expiration of the oldest Lease by at least 1 ms in that case.

* Prior to release 0.9.7, when included in a DatabaseStore Message sent by the
  originating router, the router set all the published leases' expirations to
  the same value, that of the earliest lease. As of release 0.9.7, the router
  publishes the actual lease expiration for each lease. This is an
  implementation detail and not part of the structures specification.

This structure defines the means to contact a router through a transport

1 byte Integer_ defining the relative cost of using the address, where 0 is
free and 255 is expensive, followed by the expiration Date_ after which the

comes a String_ defining the transport protocol this router address uses.
Finally there is a Mapping_ containing all of the transport specific options
necessary to establish the connection, such as IP address, port number, email
address, URL, etc.

Notes
`````
* Cost is typically 5 or 6 for SSU, and 10 or 11 for NTCP.

* Expiration is currently unused, always null (all zeroes). As of release
  0.9.3, the expiration is assumed zero and not stored, so any non-zero
  expiration will fail in the RouterInfo signature verification. Implementing
  expiration (or another use for these bytes) will be a backwards-incompatible
  change. Routers MUST set this field to all zeros. As of release 0.9.12, a
  non-zero expiration field is again recognized, however we must wait several
  releases to use this field, until the vast majority of the network recognizes
  it.

* The following options, while not required, are standard and expected to be
  present in most router addresses: "host" (an IPv4 or IPv6 address or host
  name) and "port".

Notes
`````
* The peer_size Integer_ may be followed by a list of that many router hashes.
  This is currently unused. It was intended for a form of restricted routes,
  which is unimplemented.
  Certain implementations may require the list to be sorted so the signature is invariant.
  To be researched before enabling this feature.

* The signature may be verified using the signing public key of the
  router_ident.

* See the network database page [NETDB-ROUTERINFO]_ for standard options that
  are expected to be present in all router infos.

* Very old routers required the addresses to be sorted by the SHA256 of their data
  so the signature is invariant.
  This is no longer required, and not worth implementing for backward compatibility.
