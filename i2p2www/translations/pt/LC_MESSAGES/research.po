"As of release 0.9.25, I2P supports a router family configuration.\n"
"This provides researchers who run multiple routers with the means to "
"publicly identify those routers.\n"
"In turn, this helps the I2P project understand that these routers are not"
" running an attack on the network.\n"
"It also will prevent other routers from including multiple routers of the"
" family in a single tunnel,\n"
"which could lead to deanonymization.\n"
"Routers that appear to be colluding but do not have a declared family may"
" be assumed to\n"
"be an attack on the network, and may be blocked.\n"
"The best way to ensure the success of your research project is to work "
"with us."
