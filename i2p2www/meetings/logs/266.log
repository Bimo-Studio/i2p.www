20:00:00 <zzz> 0) Hi
20:00:00 <zzz> 1) 0.9.33 update (zzz)
20:00:00 <zzz> 2) 34C3 planning (zzz)
20:00:03 <zzz> 0) Hi
20:00:05 <zzz> hi
20:00:30 <zzz> 1) 0.9.33 update (zzz)
20:00:48 <zzz> 0.9.33 dev is off to a roaring start, with 20K lines of diff so far
20:00:55 <zzz> lots of good fixes
20:01:17 <zlatinb> hi
20:01:42 <zzz> also, 0.9.32 android was later than our 2-week target, so we've made some process changes to make sure we review the google play crashes before the desktop release
20:02:01 <i2pr> [Slack/str4d] hi
20:02:02 <zzz> this should enable a sooner and higher-quality android release
20:02:29 <i2pr> [Slack/str4d] I've got more CSS and JSP patches sitting locally, that I hope to get cleaned up and into mtn this weekend for longer review.
20:02:40 <zzz> I think we're on track for a late-january 0.9.33 release. That means big changes should go in this month, before CCC
20:03:28 <zzz> we have more streaming tweaks to do, and I've been fixing susimail issues this week
20:04:12 <zzz> anything else on 1) ?
20:04:24 <zlatinb> if I may suggest making dev builds available on postman’s tracker
20:04:35 <zlatinb> some people will download and try anything that comes out there
20:04:50 <zzz> I believe you can get them via magnets or torrent files from bobthebuilder.com
20:05:17 <zlatinb> oh yes, it’s just that the presence on postman brings in a lot of visibility
20:05:43 <zzz> ok, talk to the bobthebuilder op about that, good idea
20:05:54 <zzz> anything else on 1) ?
20:05:58 <i2pr> [Slack/str4d] Also, we now have continuous builds on Travis CI as well, so keep an eye on https://travis-ci.org/i2p/i2p.i2p  for another perspective
20:06:44 <zzz> str4d, if you can set up a irc bot for that, that might help, hard to remember to check a website
20:07:17 <zzz> anything else on 1) ?
20:08:01 <zzz> 2) 34C3 planning (zzz)
20:08:10 <zzz> ok, the sticker situation is under control
20:08:25 <zzz> eche|on has the train tickets
20:08:33 <zzz> hottuna signed us up on the wiki
20:08:43 <zzz> has noisy square showed up on the wiki yet?
20:08:50 <zzz> and who has the banner?
20:09:23 <zzz> I'll set up the twitter DM group later unless somebody else does it first
20:11:01 <zzz> hearing no response... anything else on 2) ?
20:12:01 <zzz> anything else for the meeting?
20:12:33 <orignal> maybe it makes sense to set meeting less frequent?
20:12:47 <orignal> due lack of interest
20:12:56 <orignal> but promote it more
20:13:09 <i2pr> [Slack/str4d] Looking forward to it!
20:13:35 <i2pr> [Slack/str4d] I think monthly is about right
20:13:41 <zzz> orignal, maybe, we can discuss that at ccc. 
20:13:47 <i2pr> [Slack/str4d] Whether this is a good time is always up for debate
20:13:56 <zzz> The PR team could perhaps promote it more, for sure
20:14:10 <orignal> I would make it always a week before release
20:14:16 <i2pr> [Slack/str4d] zzz, just pushed config for IRC notifications to i2p.i2p
20:14:34 <zzz> also, planning note, our next meetings will be in-person at CCC. We will not have a meeting Jan. 2.
20:14:35 <orignal> at least it would have a subject
20:14:44 <zzz> Our next IRC meeting will be Tues. Feb. 6
20:15:33 <zzz> check out the thread on zzz.i2p for topics for CCC meetings
20:15:42 <zzz> add your suggestions there if you have any
20:15:47 <zzz> anything else for the meeting?
20:15:52 * zzz grabs the baffer
20:16:58 <i2pr> [Slack/str4d] I'll be doing more work on proposals ahead of CCC
20:17:11 * zzz *bafs* the meeting closed
