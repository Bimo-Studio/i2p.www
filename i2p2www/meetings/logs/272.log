20:00:16 <zlatinb> hi
20:00:21 <zzz> 1) 0.9.35 release status (zzz)
20:00:42 <zzz> 35's been out for a week, no major complaints so far
20:01:03 <zzz> maven jars are up, I believe meeh will have android out shortly
20:01:20 <zzz> haven't heard from mhatta yet re: official debian
20:01:57 <zzz> anything else on 1) ?
20:02:44 <zzz> 2) NTCP2 update (zzz)
20:03:04 <zzz> we finished up the spec last week, and we have several routers live on the network
20:03:26 <zzz> i2pd is proceeding with their implementation and testing
20:03:30 <eche|on> good so far
20:03:52 <zzz> I have some cleanups to do, and I haven't tested the firewalled flavor yet, but things are going pretty well
20:04:21 <zzz> I also posted a quick FAQ today on our forums
20:04:43 <zzz> anything else on 2) ?
20:05:37 <zzz> 3) LS2 meeting announcement (zzz)
20:06:01 <zzz> we're going to follow the same process for the next proposal, which is 123 "LS2"
20:06:15 <zzz> also covering new crypto, service lookup, massive multihoming, and related topics
20:06:36 <zzz> the first meeting will be Monday July 9 at 7 PM UTC in #ls2
20:06:45 <eche|on> great task, lots of jobs to do
20:07:05 <zzz> yeah, have no idea how it's going to go, but we need to get started, been too long
20:07:30 <zzz> anything else on 3) ?
20:07:44 <eche|on> nope
20:08:23 <zzz> 4) 2H 2018 funding program (zab/zzz)
20:08:32 <zzz> announcement is up on i2pforum.i2p and zzz.i2p
20:08:42 <zzz> the program is open to new applicants
20:08:51 <zzz> deadline is Wednesday July 25
20:09:13 <zzz> if anybody has any questions, you can ask them now, or after the meeting
20:09:34 <zzz> anybody have any questions about the program?
20:09:38 <eche|on> one point: not the whole i2p team needs to approve new members (the team is not yet perfectly defined, as in team of noted persons on webpage or any other group)
20:10:13 <zlatinb> I would think at least those already on the paid program
20:10:42 <zzz> true, I guess collectively we need to approve... not that we need individual approval from each
20:10:45 <eche|on> yeah
20:10:50 <zzz> does that sound right?
20:10:58 <eche|on> just to want point this out to sharpen that point
20:11:12 <zzz> ok
20:11:26 <zzz> anything else on 4) ?
